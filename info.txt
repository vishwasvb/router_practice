unlike frameworks like Angular, React doesn't have the concept of routing
React is a simple lightweight library and not a complete frameWork
React is only responsible for rendering the view.

npm i react-router-dom@4.3.1

Above library is the implementation of react router for DOM or Browser
the same way we have react-router-native, it is used for mobile applications
